# Discourse Daily Challenge

![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-v1.4.0-blue)

A Discourse plugin for running time-limited challenges. Participants check in by posting with a challenge hashtag or uploading a photo. Admins and moderators get a real-time leaderboard dashboard, automated weekly progress posts, a final results announcement, optional badge awards for completers, and a bot user that sends personal DMs for check-in confirmations, reminders, and @mention commands.

## Features

- **Hashtag or photo check-ins** — participants check in by posting with the configured hashtag (e.g. `#workout`) or by uploading any image to the challenge topic
- **Configurable check-in interval** — daily or weekly, with configurable week start day (Sunday, Monday, or Saturday); duplicate check-ins within the same period are silently ignored
- **Real-time admin dashboard** — shows all active challenges simultaneously, each with its own stats, leaderboard, and per-participant contribution grid
- **Archived challenges accordion** — past challenges collapsed into an expandable section showing final participant count, winner, and completion rate
- **Per-challenge timezone** — start/end dates, weekly post timing, and check-in windows are all evaluated in the challenge's configured timezone
- **Automated weekly leaderboard posts** — posted to the challenge topic by the system user on a configurable day and hour
- **Final results post** — automatically posted the day after the challenge ends, listing all participants who met the goal
- **Badge awards** — optionally award a custom Discourse badge to every participant who reaches the check-in goal
- **Manual leaderboard trigger** — admins can post the leaderboard at any time from the challenge management page
- **Admin check-in management** — add or remove check-ins for any user from the admin panel (for missed posts, support requests, etc.)
- **Moderator access** — full moderators can access challenge management via a dedicated sidebar section with Dashboard and Challenges tabs
- **Category Moderator Access** — category moderators can manage challenges in their assigned categories via a dedicated /challenges route, separate from the admin panel
- **Per-challenge configuration** — each challenge has its own hashtag, dates, timezone, check-in interval, check-in goal, weekly post schedule, and badge settings
- **🤖 ChallengeBot DMs** — check-in confirmation DMs with streak info and a clickable topic link, reminder DMs for participants who haven't checked in (daily: after 2+ missed days; weekly: on the last day of the week if not yet checked in), and @mention commands for personal stats — all sent as private messages from a configurable bot account

## Installation

Add the plugin to your Discourse `app.yml`:

```yaml
hooks:
  after_code:
    - exec:
        cd: $home/plugins
        cmd:
          - git clone https://github.com/R23DPrinting/discourse-daily-challenge.git
```

Then rebuild your container:

```bash
./launcher rebuild app
```

## Configuration

### Site Settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `daily_challenge_enabled` | true | Master on/off switch for the plugin |
| `daily_challenge_mod_access_enabled` | true | Allow full site moderators to manage challenges |
| `daily_challenge_category_mod_access_enabled` | true | Allow category moderators to manage challenges in their categories |
| `daily_challenge_bot_username` | "" | Username of the bot account that sends check-in confirmation DMs, reminder DMs, and @mention command responses |

### Setting Up ChallengeBot

The bot features are optional. To enable them:

1. **Create the bot user account.** SSH into your server and run:
   ```bash
   cd /var/discourse
   ./launcher enter app
   rake admin:create
   ```
   When prompted, enter the bot's email, a strong password, and answer **n** to admin privileges.

2. **Approve the account and set trust level.** In **Admin → Users**, find the newly created account (it will have an auto-generated username like `user1`) and:
   - Click **Approve** to approve the account
   - Set **Trust Level** to **1**

3. **Set the username.** The account will have an auto-generated username. Go to the account's profile and update the username to `ChallengeBot` (or whatever you prefer).

4. **Optionally** set a profile picture for the bot account.

5. **Configure the plugin.** Go to **Admin → Plugins → Challenges → Settings** and enter the username in the **Bot username** field.
   > ⚠️ This field is case-sensitive — enter the username exactly as it appears in the profile.

If no bot username is configured, all bot features are silently disabled and challenges continue to work normally.

### Creating a Challenge

Go to **Admin → Plugins → Challenges → Challenges → New Challenge**.

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Topic ID** | The ID of the Discourse topic where participants will post. The plugin fetches and displays the topic title as a confirmation after you enter the ID. |
| **Hashtag trigger** | The hashtag (without `#`) that triggers a check-in when included in a post. Only letters, digits, and underscores are allowed. |
| **Start date** | The first day of the challenge (inclusive). |
| **End date** | The last day of the challenge (inclusive). Check-ins are accepted through the end of this day in the challenge timezone. Must be after the start date. |
| **Challenge timezone** | Timezone used for all date boundaries, weekly post timing, and the final post trigger. Defaults to UTC. |
| **Check-in interval** | Whether participants check in daily or weekly. |
| **Week start** | For weekly challenges: which day starts the week (Sunday, Monday, or Saturday). Only shown when interval is set to Weekly. |
| **Check-ins needed** | The number of check-ins required to complete the challenge and qualify for the badge. |
| **Description** | Optional internal note about the challenge (not shown to participants). |
| **Enable weekly leaderboard post** | When enabled, the system automatically posts a leaderboard update to the challenge topic on a schedule. |
| **Post day of week** | Day the weekly post is published (Sunday–Saturday, in the challenge timezone). |
| **Post hour (0-23)** | Hour the weekly post is published, in the challenge timezone. |
| **Award completion badge** | When enabled, a Discourse badge is created and automatically granted to participants who reach the check-in goal when the challenge ends. Requires a badge name. |
| **Badge name** | Name of the badge to create (e.g. "March Fitness Champion"). Auto-populates from the topic title when a topic ID is entered. Required when "Award completion badge" is enabled. |
| **Enable reminder DMs** | When enabled (and a bot username is configured), sends reminder DMs to participants who haven't checked in recently. Defaults to enabled. |

## How Check-ins Work

A check-in is recorded automatically when a participant posts in the linked topic and their post matches either condition:

1. **Hashtag** — the post body contains the challenge hashtag (e.g. `#workout`). The match is case-insensitive and must be a whole word (preceded by a space or the start of the line).
2. **Image upload** — the post includes an image attachment (jpg, jpeg, png, gif, webp, heic, or avif).

**Rules:**
- Only one check-in is recorded per user per period: one per calendar day for daily challenges, or one per calendar week for weekly challenges (week boundaries determined by the configured week start day, evaluated in the challenge's timezone).
- Check-ins are only recorded while the challenge is active (between start date and end date, evaluated in the challenge's timezone).
- Anonymous users cannot check in.
- System posts and non-regular posts are ignored.

## ChallengeBot DMs

When a bot username is configured, the bot sends private messages for the following events:

### Check-in Confirmation
Every time a participant successfully checks in, they receive a DM with:
- A link to the challenge topic
- Their current streak (e.g. "5-day streak 🔥")

### Reminder DMs
Participants who fall behind receive a reminder DM including their current check-in count and the goal:
- **Daily challenges** — sent to participants who haven't checked in for 2 or more consecutive days
- **Weekly challenges** — sent on the last day of the challenge week to participants who haven't checked in that week

A Redis key with a 25-hour TTL prevents duplicate reminders per user per challenge per day.

## @ChallengeBot Commands

Members can mention the bot in any active challenge topic to receive a DM with their stats. Commands are never replied to in the topic — responses are always sent as private messages.

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `@ChallengeBot status` | Stats across all active challenges you've participated in |
| `@ChallengeBot leaderboard` | Current top-10 standings for this challenge |
| `@ChallengeBot streak` | Your current streak for this challenge |
| `@ChallengeBot checkins` | Full list of all your check-in dates for this challenge |
| `@ChallengeBot progress` | Check-ins done vs needed, time remaining, on-track status |
| `@ChallengeBot help` | List all available commands |

> **Rate limit:** commands are limited to 10 per user per hour. If exceeded, the bot sends a single notice and ignores further commands until the window resets.

## Admin Dashboard

The dashboard (**Admin → Plugins → Challenges → Dashboard**) shows all currently active challenges. Each challenge gets its own section with:

- **Challenge header** — hashtag, linked topic title, and day progress
- **Stats tiles** — total participants, average check-ins, and overall challenge progress percentage
- **Leaderboard table** — ranked by total check-ins, showing current streak and completion percentage per participant
- **Contribution grid** — click any row to expand a GitHub-style heatmap of that participant's check-in history for the challenge period

If there are no active challenges, a friendly message is shown with a link to create one.

### Archived Challenges

Below the active challenges, completed challenges are shown in a collapsible accordion. Each entry shows:

- Challenge hashtag and topic title
- Date range
- Total participants, winner (most check-ins), and completion rate

Expand any entry to see the details and a link to the original topic.

## Weekly Posts

When **Enable weekly leaderboard post** is turned on for a challenge, the plugin posts a markdown leaderboard table to the challenge topic every week at the configured day and hour (in the challenge's timezone). The post is made by the system user and includes:

- The week's date range
- Current day progress in the challenge
- A ranked table of all participants with their check-in count, goal, and progress percentage

You can also trigger a leaderboard post manually at any time from the challenge detail page using the **Post leaderboard now** button.

## Final Results Post

The day after a challenge ends (evaluated in the challenge's timezone), the plugin automatically posts a final results summary to the challenge topic. The post includes:

- A list of all participants who reached the check-in goal
- A summary of how many out of the total participants completed the challenge
- Congratulations to completers, or an encouraging message if no one reached the goal

The final post is sent exactly once per challenge.

## Badge Awarding

If **Award completion badge** is enabled and a **Badge name** is provided, the plugin:

1. Creates a Discourse badge (Silver tier) when the challenge is saved
2. Automatically grants the badge to every participant who reaches the check-in goal when the final results post is published
3. Updates the badge name and description if you edit the challenge settings

The badge description is automatically set to reference the linked topic title (e.g. "Awarded to participants who completed all required check-ins in March Challenge.").

## Admin Check-in Management

Admins can manually add or remove check-ins for any user from the challenge detail page (**Admin → Plugins → Challenges → Challenges → [challenge name]**). This is useful for:

- Adding check-ins for participants who posted outside the topic
- Correcting missed check-ins due to technical issues
- Removing erroneous check-ins

Manually added check-ins are marked with an "Admin" source label in the check-in list.
